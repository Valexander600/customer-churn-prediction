# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression  

This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict which customers are most likely to leave the service (churn).  
Using **Logistic Regression**, the model identifies behavioral and demographic patterns that contribute to customer attrition.

## 📊 Key Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized trends in customer demographics, tenure, and payment methods.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Cleaned and encoded categorical variables for model readiness.  
- **Model Building:** Implemented Logistic Regression to classify churn vs. non-churn customers.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measured accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.  
- **Business Insight:** Highlighted key risk factors that telecom companies can address to reduce churn.
